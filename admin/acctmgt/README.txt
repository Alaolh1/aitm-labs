Scripts for user creation and deletion, given a set of emails of form "lastname firstname" <email@some.domain>, comma separated, no comma at end

Written by Charles Betz. I'm not impressed with them either. But you do what you have to do.

these scripts assume the files at the root of ~/courseadmin are what need to be processed.
numbered archives in ~/courseadmin are disregarded.
