= Lab 2 technical notes

Multi-user Vagrant on a server is still an unsolved problem.

Wanted to avoid multiple copies of images so first I set up all students' VAGRANT_HOME the same:

VAGRANT_HOME=/var/vagrant/.vagrant.d

Running into permissions issues with the /var/vagrant/.vagrant.d/data/lock.fpcollision.lock file, which gets locked by 1 user and then no others can access it.

Searching on the Vagrant release notes:

* https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

we see "Vagrant locks machine access to one Vagrant process at a time. This will protect against two simultaneous up actions happening on the same environment."

So, went with approach of copying 3 gb file from /var/vagrant/.vagrant.d/boxes to every student's directory. Waste of space, but it works. Looking for ideas.
