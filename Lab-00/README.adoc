= Lab 00 notes

This lab is a simple, "get them started" lab that nevertheless requires detail orientation. Some of it is specific to the institution, but some is more general (ssh access is a common need.)

I don't like relying on external installation resources but time is pressing. May rewrite them as time permits.


_Retrospective notes after 2015 fall run: this needs complete QA & cleanup before Spring 2016. Strongly recommend not linking to other resources. Need to do our own Putty install & config. Not using vi. _

_There should be some discussion of the difference between password and ssh login and why ssh is preferable._
