= Lab 05 technical notes

== Test driven tomcat
Experienced people will note that the MainServlet java class is not being tested. This is possible, but gets complex - see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12945907/how-to-mock-the-httpservletrequest and related links.

== Kanban SaaS
consider setting up class taiga http://taigaio.github.io/taiga-doc/dist/setup-alternatives.html

Kanbanery was ruled out because the free version only allows 2 team members

Asana was considered but it's not a board
