= Lab 02 IT Infrastructure

In this lab you will learn more about IT infrastructure by running Vagrant and learning basic "infrastructure as code" principles.

==  Running Vagrant on the Course Server #

Vagrant is already installed on the SEIS660 course server, but you need to take a few steps before you can use it.
Assuming you have .ssh configured and have logged in, you should find yourself in your default directory.

Note, in the following instructions when you see teststu1, substitute your user id.

Do not type the "$" symbol - this represents the command prompt you see when you log into Linux. It may also be a "#" or have some directory information in front of it, e.g.

	teststu1@seis660:~$

First, always confirm where you are by issuing the "pwd" (print working directory) command:

    $ pwd
    /home/student/teststu1

and examine what is in your directory:

	teststu1@seis660:~$ ls -al
	total 28
	drwxr-xr-x  6 teststu1 student 4096 Feb  8 11:37 .
	drwxr-xr-x 25 root     root    4096 Feb  8 11:28 ..
	-rw-------  1 teststu1 student  263 Feb  8 11:34 .bash_history
	-rw-r--r--  1 teststu1 student  220 Feb  8 11:28 .bash_logout
	-rw-r--r--  1 teststu1 student 3760 Feb  8 11:28 .bashrc
	-rw-r--r--  1 teststu1 student  675 Feb  8 11:28 .ssh

In any command line environment, it is good to run these commands (pwd and ls, or their equivalents) frequently so you maintain situational awareness of where you are and what might be affected by any commands you run.

Now, make a "vagrant" directory:

	teststu1@seis660:~$ mkdir vagrant
	teststu1@seis660:~$

Type "ls -al" again:

	total 28
	drwxr-xr-x  6 teststu1 student 4096 Feb  8 11:37 .
	drwxr-xr-x 25 root     root    4096 Feb  8 11:28 ..
	-rw-------  1 teststu1 student  263 Feb  8 11:34 .bash_history
	-rw-r--r--  1 teststu1 student  220 Feb  8 11:28 .bash_logout
	-rw-r--r--  1 teststu1 student 3760 Feb  8 11:28 .bashrc
	-rw-r--r--  1 teststu1 student  675 Feb  8 11:28 .profile
	-rw-r--r--  1 teststu1 student  675 Feb  8 11:28 .ssh
	drwxr-xr-x  2 teststu1 student 4096 Feb  8 12:19 vagrant

Confirm that you now have the directory.

Change to it:

	teststu1@seis660:~$ cd vagrant
	teststu1@seis660:~/vagrant$

Type the following command carefully:

	teststu1@seis660:~/vagrant$ vagrant init precise64

You should see the following:

	A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now
	ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read
	the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
	`vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant.
	teststu1@seis660:~/vagrant$

If you get an error with "vagrant up" like this:

````
An error occurred while downloading the remote file. The error message, if any, is reproduced below. Please fix this error and try again.


Couldn't open file /home/student/akou0009/vagrant/precise64
````

try

    vagrant box add "precise64" http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box

Now, let's try something that will not work:

	teststu1@seis660:~/vagrant$ vagrant up
	Bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
	==> default: Importing base box 'precise64'...
	==> default: Matching MAC address for NAT networking...
	==> default: Setting the name of the VM: vagrant_default_1423420554497_66907
	==> default: Fixed port collision for 22 => 2222. Now on port 2203.
	==> default: Clearing any previously set network interfaces...
	==> default: Preparing network interfaces based on configuration...
	    default: Adapter 1: nat    ==> default: Forwarding ports...
	    default: 22 => 2203 (adapter 1)    ==> default: Booting VM...
	==> default: Waiting for machine to boot. This may take a few minutes...
	The private key to connect to the machine via SSH must be owned
	by the user running Vagrant. This is a strict requirement from
	SSH itself. Please fix the following key to be owned by the user
	running Vagrant:

	/var/vagrant/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key
	teststu1@seis660:~/vagrant$

What happened? Let's do a little troubleshooting. Unlike a lot of error messages, this one gives you everything you need to fix the problem. It's an ownership issue with a file called "insecure_private_key" in the directory  /var/vagrant/.vagrant.d/.

When you create a new virtual machine with Vagrant and VirtualBox, Vagrant needs to be able to talk to it on your behalf, and uses .ssh for this purpose. Just as we created a private key for you to hold on your laptop, with a matching public key on the server, so you need to have ANOTHER private/public key pair to communicate between your ssh session running directly on seis660, and your new virtual machine. And, because the Vagrant machine is pre-baked (more on this to come), you have to start by using a predefined key pair that comes with Vagrant.

Review the image below. Right-click and open the image below in its own window or tab if it is too small.  ![architecture](Resources/sshDetails.jpg)


So, let's copy the key to your own .ssh directory. First, we need to clean up our failed attempt:

	teststu1@seis660:~$ vagrant destroy
	default: Are you sure you want to destroy the 'default' VM? [y/N] y
	==> default: Forcing shutdown of VM...
	==> default: Destroying VM and associated drives...

Then:

	teststu1@seis660:~$ pwd
	/home/student/teststu1/vagrant
	teststu1@seis660:~$ cd ../.ssh
	teststu1@seis660:~/.ssh$ cp /var/SEIS660/public/insecure_private_key .   #DON"T miss the period there
	teststu1@seis660:~/.ssh$ ls -al
	total 12
	drwxr-xr-x 2 teststu1 student 4096 Feb  8 13:45 .
	drwxr-xr-x 6 teststu1 student 4096 Feb  8 13:18 ..
	-rw-r--r-- 1 teststu1 student    0 Feb  8 13:18 authorized_keys
	-rw-r----- 1 teststu1 student 1675 Feb  8 13:45 insecure_private_key
	teststu1@seis660:~/.ssh$ chmod 600 insecure_private_key
	teststu1@seis660:~/.ssh$ ls -al
	total 12
	drwxr-xr-x 2 teststu1 student 4096 Feb  8 13:45 .
	drwxr-xr-x 6 teststu1 student 4096 Feb  8 13:18 ..
	-rw-r--r-- 1 teststu1 student    0 Feb  8 13:18 authorized_keys
	-rw------- 1 teststu1 student 1675 Feb  8 13:45 insecure_private_key

What did we just do?

1. We changed our working directory to .ssh
2. We copied the key there
3. We changed the permissions on the key so that only we can read and write it (ssh requires this).
However, this isn't enough. We need to tell Vagrant to look at this key, not its default. So:


```
teststu1@seis660:~/.ssh$ cd ../vagrant/
teststu1@seis660:~/vagrant$ nano Vagrantfile
GNU nano 2.2.6                   File: Vagrantfile

# The most common configuration options are documented and commented below.

# config.vm.box_check_update = false

# Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port

# Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
# using a specific IP.
# config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"

The above is a representation of being in nano, a simple editor for Linux (easier to learn than vi). In the Vagrantfile, use your down arrow key until you find the line:

	config.vm.box = "precise64"

and immediately under it, add the line:

	  config.ssh.private_key_path = "~/.ssh/insecure_private_key"

Holding down the Ctrl key, type the letter X. At the bottom of the screen it will say

	Save modified buffer (ANSWERING "No" WILL DESTROY CHANGES) ?

Type Y

It will then say:

	File Name to Write: Vagrantfile

Hit Return.

Congratulations! But, what does this all mean?

You now have your own personal Linux machine, operating within the main course server, on which you are the administrator. You have tremendous freedom to experiment with its configuration. If you damage something, you simply need to exit out to the main server command prompt and run "vagrant destroy." This will erase the machine. You can then run "vagrant up" again and the machine will be restored. Note, if you destroy the VM you will LOSE ALL DATA you have on the machine, unless that data is stored in your ~/vagrant directory.

DO NOT ATTEMPT to bridge your VM to the external world. It is not hardened and possibly vulnerable. As long as you do not mess with the network configuration, you will be fine. In a future lab, you will see how to run Firefox on the course server in a X11 window over ssh on your local machine, so you can safely browse to your VM.

For further information, see https://docs.vagrantup.com/.

# IT Infrastructure Lab 3 Instructions #
**Overview**

In this lab, you will get a very simple introduction to the concept of "infrastructure as code" using shell scripting on your virtual machine in conjunction with Git and Github

**Prerequisites**

Lab 1: You must have configured ssh and run the Linux tutorial (or be comfortable otherwise with Linux command-line tools).

Lab 2: You must have successfully created your own virtual machine (VM) using Vagrant.


## Part 1: Command line operations ##

You will do the exercises in this part on your new Vagrant VM.

Using the skills you learned in the previous lab,  perform the following steps:

**Configure a directory structure**

* Directory A should contain directories B, C and D

* Directory C should contain directories E and F

* Directory D should contain directories G, H and I

* Directory H should contain directories J and K


Every directory should have a file in it, with the letter of the directory doubled in lower case. E.g., directory A should have aa, F would have ff, etc.

**Install and use tree**

Install tree

    vagrant@precise64~: sudo apt-get install -y tree

> Note, the "-y" is critical, as this makes it possible to script apt-get

Use it to inspect your directory structure. It should look like:

````
vagrant@precise64:~$ tree

|-- A
|   |-- aa
|   |-- B
|   |   `-- bb
|   |-- C
|   |   `-- cc
|   `-- D
|       `-- dd
|-- C
|   |-- cc
|   |-- E
|   |   `-- ee
|   `-- F
|       `-- ff
|-- D
|   |-- dd
|   |-- G
|   |   `-- gg
|   |-- H
|   |   |-- hh
|   |   |-- J
|   |   |   `-- jj
|   |   `-- K
|   |       `-- kk
|   `-- I
|       `-- ii
````

Now, output the tree to a file. How?

    vagrant@precise64:~$tree > tree.txt

Review the text file:

    vagrant@precise64:~$cat tree.txt

Why did I make the directory structure so detailed? This is typical of setting up infrastructure as code - you need to be able to maintain focus and successfully set up instructions that are both complicated and yet repetitive.

	⁃	If you have developed an approach to "mkdir" and "touch" that you wish to refer to later you should copy it to an external text file (outside of your Vagrant VM).

Exit and destroy your VM.

````
vagrant@precise64:~$ exit
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/vagrant$ vagrant destroy -f
==> default: Forcing shutdown of VM...
==> default: Destroying VM and associated drives...
````

## Part 2: Working with git

You will do the exercises in part 2 on the main server, not your VM.

**Set up Github.com & fork this lab**

Go to http://github.com and set up a user account. You probably do NOT want to use your St. Thomas email address for this (it is unlikely it will be available.)

> Notice that you will have to keep track of TWO IDs and substitute them at appropriate times:
> YourStudentID and YourGithubID

Skim https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/ (it's OK if you don't understand it all immediately - just keep following the steps here)

Go to https://github.com/StThomas-seis660/Lab-03 and fork the repo. Press the Fork button at top right:

![fork](resources/fork.jpg)

Now, go to your home account on Github and find the URL for the forked repository.

Important: you should NOT be copying this:

    https://github.com/StThomas-seis660/Lab-03

Instead, it should look like this:

    https://github.com/YourGithubID/Lab-03

Clone the Github repository you forked as Lab-03 to your home directory /home/student/YourID/. Go into it and verify the contents look as below. Notice the username YourID; **this must be replaced with your Github user name**.

````
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~$ git clone https://github.com/YourGithubID/Lab-03.git
Cloning into 'Lab-03'...
remote: Counting objects: 78, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (60/60), done.

YourStudentID@serverXXX:~$ cd Lab-03/
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/Lab-03$ ls
Lab-03-Instructions.md	LICENSE  README.md  resources  starter.sh  Vagrantfile
````

**Try git out**

Be sure you are in the new Lab-03 directory that git created:

    YourStudentID@serverXXX:~$ cd ~/Lab-03/

Create a file called YourStudentID-testfile, e.g. stud0001-testfile.md.

    YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/Lab-03$ nano your_student_ID-testfile.md

(Again, do not put in "YourStudentID" literally. Substitute your student ID. Notice the following examples were done with "YourStudentID" as the student ID.)

Put some Markdown content in it, starting with  the phrase "Hello World." ([What's Markdown?](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)).

Exit nano (ctrl-X, saving as prompted).

Add your file to your git repository

    YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/Lab-03$ git add YourStudentID-testfile.md
    YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/Lab-03$ git commit -m "my first commit"

You will get:

````
[master 312919f] my first commit
 Committer: test <YourStudentID@serverXXX.gps.stthomas.edu>
Your name and email address were configured automatically based
on your username and hostname. Please check that they are accurate.
You can suppress this message by setting them explicitly:

    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email you@example.com

After doing this, you may fix the identity used for this commit with:

    git commit --amend --reset-author

 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 YourStudentID-testfile.md
````

Disregard the issue with your user name and email for now.

Now, edit the file again.

    YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/Lab-03$ nano YourStudentID-testfile.md

Add "Hello Again" as a second line and exit nano in the usual way.

You have now made a change, relative to what you committed. You can see that change through issuing the command 'git diff':

````
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/Lab-03$ git diff
diff --git a/YourStudentID-testfile.md b/YourStudentID-testfile.md

We will be covering git in more detail as we go, but this clearly shows that Hello Again has been added.

Commit it again (you only need to add it once):

Hit "q" to exit the commit review. (You can keep going back, but then you are getting into earlier commits on the cloned repository that I did while setting it up. More on that later.)

All of these changes have been locally committed to your git instance on your Vagrant virtual machine. Let's send them back up to your fork at Github. You will need to authenticate (we could set up ssh to github, but not right now):

````

````

At this point you have pushed your file up to your LOCAL fork of the Lab-03 repository on your Github account. I cannot see it unless I navigate to your Github site.

Go back to your browser and issue a pull request:

![pull](resources/pull.jpg)

If your work is acceptable, I will allow it to be merged back into the main Lab-03 repository (actually the Spring 2015 branch).

There is much to learn about git and this lab is not intended to be a full tutorial, but rather means to an end, and a quick flavor of the techniques. We will cover further aspects as necessary.

##Part 3: Automated provisioning and infrastructure as code

This section will bring together your VM work with git, as you develop a script to automate your activities and commit it to source control.

**Vagrant up from the lab directory**
We will not vagrant up from your ~/vagrant directory. Instead, we will vagrant up from your ~/Lab-03 directory. A Vagrantfile has been placed there with the correct private key location.

````
teststud@seis660:~/Lab-03$ vagrant up

You will get the following prompt. It is a bug of some sort I have not been able to figure out. 50 points for anyone who can fix it. Type "vagrant" to move past it:

**Script your work**

Go into your VM:

````
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/Lab-03$ vagrant ssh
Welcome to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.2.0-23-generic x86_64)

 * Documentation:  https://help.ubuntu.com/
New release '14.04.1 LTS' available.
Run 'do-release-upgrade' to upgrade to it.

Welcome to your Vagrant-built virtual machine.
Last login: Fri Sep 14 06:23:18 2012 from 10.0.2.2
vagrant@precise64:~$
````

Go to the /vagrant directory. (Not to be confused with /home/vagrant.)

This is important. Your /vagrant directory is linked to the host machine on the outside. In fact, if you examine it, you will realize it is your ~/Lab-03 directory! You should see your *-testfile.md.

````
vagrant@precise64:~$ cd /vagrant
vagrant@precise64:/vagrant$ ls
Lab-03-Instructions.md  LICENSE  README.md  resources  starter.sh  YourStudentID-testfile.md  Vagrantfile
````

Now for the main work of Part 3:

Starting with starter.sh, write a shell script that automates:

1. the directory creation you did manually in Part 1
2. tree installation and use.
3. git installation

Review your Unix commands as necessary. The install commands are:

    apt-get install -y tree
    apt-get install -y git

  * Use Nano. Notice the shebang (#!/bin/bash) at the top of starter.sh.

  * Name it YourStudentID-Lab03.sh

  * You will need to change (chmod) the permissions correctly to run it.

So:

    vagrant@precise64:/vagrant$ cp starter.sh YourStudentID-Lab03.sh
    vagrant@precise64:/vagrant$ sudo chmod 755 YourStudentID-Lab03.sh

Remember to substitute your actual ID for "YourStudentID."

````
vagrant@vagrant:/vagrant$ sudo chmod 755 YourStudentID-Lab03.sh
vagrant@vagrant:/vagrant$ ls -l
total 44
-rw-r--r-- 1 vagrant vagrant 14183 Feb 20 15:22 Lab-03-Instructions.md

-rw-r--r-- 1 vagrant vagrant   296 Feb 20 15:45 Vagrantfile
````

Run the script to confirm you can execute it (it's still empty, and will run fine - it just won't do anything):

    vagrant@XXXXX:~/vagrant$ ./YourStudentID-Lab03.sh  <- notice the "./"

Create your script.

    vagrant@XXXXX:~/vagrant$ nano YourStudentID-Lab03.sh

Oops, something seems to be wrong when you run it:

````
vagrant@XXXXX:/vagrant$ ./YourStudentID-Lab03.sh
E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13: Permission denied)
E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?
````

Because the script has installations in it, you need to run it as superuser:

````
vagrant@XXXXX:/vagrant$ sudo ./YourStudentID-Lab03.sh

Use

    vagrant@XXXXX:/vagrant:/vagrant$ tree

to see your results and "

    vagrant@XXXXX:/vagrant:/vagrant$ rm -rf A C D

to delete the directories if you need to run the script several times to perfect it.

You can also:

    vagrant@XXXXX:/vagrant:/vagrant$ sudo apt-get remove git
    vagrant@XXXXX:/vagrant:/vagrant$ sudo apt-get remove tree

if you want to reset your environment completely.

Once you are happy with your script, add and commit locally:

````
vagrant@XXXXX:/vagrant$ git add YourStudentID-Lab03.sh
vagrant@XXXXX:/vagrant$ git commit YourStudentID-Lab03.sh -m "script commit"
[master b5f0950] script commit

````

In reviewing the directory structure, there are duplicate directories. Also, it is getting messy with three directories at the same level.

Fix the directory creation logic so that

1. there are not duplicate C and D directories (you will need to use another letter).
2. all the directories are inside one called "main"

Run it & confirm it works.

    vagrant@vagrant:/vagrant$ git log -p

*You are now doing "infrastructure as code."* You have automated a complex set of commands, checked them into source control, made significant changes, and checked in again. You can see both versions of your script.

When you are satisfied, push it back into your github remote account.

Note, your script is at risk until you do this.

Exit and vagrant destroy your vm:

    vagrant@vagrant:/vagrant$ exit
	logout
	Connection to 127.0.0.1 closed.
	YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/Lab-03$ vagrant destroy

Notice that your script is still in your ~/Lab-03 directory.

````
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/Lab-03$ cat YourStudentID-Lab03.sh
#!/bin/bash
# Starter shell script
# Rename as YourID-Lab03.sh
# Put commands below
# To run, type ./YourID-Lab03.sh (you need the "./")
# It must have permissions starting with a "7"

mkdir -p main/{A/{B,C,D},E/{F,G},H/{I,J/{K,L},M}}
touch main/{A/{aa,B/bb,C/cc,D/dd},E/{ee,F/ff,G/gg},H/{hh,I/ii,J/{jj,K/kk,L/ll},M/mm}}
apt-get install tree
apt-get install git
````

**Automate provisioning with Vagrant**

You should now be on the main server (you have destroyed your VM above).

Add and commit your Vagrantfile to source control (see above).

Edit your Vagrantfile so that it calls your *-Lab03.sh script when you provision the machine. Add the "vm.provision" line, changing MyStudentID to your ID.

````
Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
  config.vm.box = "precise64"
  config.ssh.private_key_path =   "~/.ssh/insecure_private_key"
  config.vm.provision             :shell, path: "./MyStudentID-Lab03.sh"
end
````

Vagrant up your machine and ssh into it, verify that your script has been run.
 1. Directory "main" properly configured in /vagrant
 2. git installed (run git --version)
 3. tree installed

Re-commit your Vagrantfile and push it back to origin.

Issue a pull request for me to review your work.

That is the end of this lab. Congratulations, this was a lot of work. Next week, we will start building a continuous integration pipeline with git, Java, JUnit, Tomcat, and Ant.
